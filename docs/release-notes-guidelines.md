# Release Notes Guidelines

Use this structure for every module release:

1. **Summary** — one sentence describing the value delivered.
2. **Added / Changed / Fixed** — concise bullets grouped by change type.
3. **Breaking Changes** — explicit migration steps when applicable.
4. **Upgrade Notes** — provider or Terraform version impacts.
5. **Validation Evidence** — links to CI checks and PR.
